          <h1>About Brian</h1>
          <p>
            Brian grew up in a small town in Upstate NY called Margaretville. He
            was a star baseball player and an honor roll student who spent his
            summers and weekends working at the local golf course, Hanah
            Mountain Resort and Country Club, working as a cart boy and a
            dishwasher at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout his high school years he worked at Hanah and learned the
            ins and outs of golf. From running the cart barn all the way to
            maintaining the golf course, even handling tournament operations. He
            also sat in on lessons as often as he could from the Head
            Professional Herman Keiser. By the time he graduated, not only was
            he proficient in all aspects of running a golf course but he also
            learned the proper mechanics and fundamentals of a golf swing and
            most importantly how to teach it on to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            After high school Brian joined the U.S. Army as a Combat Engineer
            and served for 5 years, 1 of those years was spent in Iraq
            conducting Route Clearance and locating IED’s. During his time in
            the military, golf stayed a very active part of his life, where he
            practiced and played regularly. After the Army, Brian became a
            private contractor for the Military as a UXO Technician, where he
            cleared old bomb testing sites of explosives and hazardous
            materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few years later Brian attended The Golf Academy of America and
            received an Associates Degree in Golf Management. That helped him
            land a job as an Outside Operations Manager for Legendary Golf
            Instructor David Leadbetter. Here Brian worked side by side with top
            players on both PGA and LPGA tours, sat in on lessons and assisted
            with drills. Brian quickly started doing all of the club repair work
            and learned to fit players and always did loft and lie adjustments
            for everyone that came to the Leadbetter Golf Academy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brian started caddying for a few LPGA tour players as a fill in and
            on his off time worked did club fittings and lessons. Not much later
            he caught the eye of one of the largest golf club manufacturers in
            the world, Cobra Golf. Cobra/Puma Golf offered Brian a ambassador
            position to be a rep for their brand. Along with Cobra/Puma, Brian
            also landed sponsorship deals with Aero-Swing, iconic training to
            increase club head speed and power. Blue Tees Rangefinders which are
            top of the line rangefinders and Sweet Rollz Putter grips which are
            unique and stylish putter grips.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brian is now branding his own name, Golf With Brian. Where he offers
            exceptional service in club and ball fittings and lessons of all
            skill levels. Brian’s plan for Golf With Brian is to have everyone
            enjoy the game and find true happiness on the golf course. He still
            caddies and travels with a few LPGA tour players and and continues
            to grow his name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brian’s unique approach to the game of golf is that he does
            everything with his clients. He doesn’t instruct, he provides
            details and examples and displays everything he teaches himself so
            you get to see it first hand. So you know that everything he has you
            do, he can do himself. “That’s why I named the company “Golf With
            Brian”, to let my clients know that they aren’t alone and that we
            are doing this together”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brian doesn’t market a certain swing type and doesn’t have a “magic
            cure” for every golfer. He starts from the foundation and instills
            proper set up fundamentals and invites nothing but the best of
            habits to come to his clients. “No matter what, for anything to
            last, you need a solid foundation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Brian provides the best all around service for everyone of his
            clients anything to do with golf he knows it. “The best feeling ever
            is watching someone succeed and to witness first hand their
            excitement and knowing you had a part in that!!! No better feeling”.
